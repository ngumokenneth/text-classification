14. So guys I’ll explain to you my stay in school. Attending lectures hasn’t been the main priority as it should be. Well provided I sit for the exams, what's the worry? Studies are for the chosen few. <academics>
15. Some lecturers should be serious and stop setting hard exams. Someone would think they never have had kids or they have never been students too. Well for this exams have seen dust<academics>
16. Notes so many you would think we are still back in high school. Are they even necessary? Why can’t someone invent a way of learning without using notes<academics>
17. Some lecturers in this place never take their job seriously. Why would they just ignore students for just asking just simple questions and just asking for a mere service which is their right as far as I’m concerned. <academics>
18. The reward system of this school is insane. As a way of promoting studies, I’m for the idea that students should be awarded in some way. <academics>

29. Guys I went to the school hospital last week and it was well improved judging by the environment and service I got . It was good.<health>I feel for our fourth year students.
