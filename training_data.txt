14. So guys I’ll explain to you my stay in school. Attending lectures hasn’t been the main priority as it should be. Well provided I sit for the exams, what's the worry? Studies are for the chosen few. <academics>
15. Some lecturers should be serious and stop setting hard exams. Someone would think they never have had kids or they have never been students too. Well for this exams have seen dust<academics>
16. Notes so many you would think we are still back in high school. Are they even necessary? Why can’t someone invent a way of learning without using notes<academics>
17. Some lecturers in this place never take their job seriously. Why would they just ignore students for just asking just simple questions and just asking for a mere service which is their right as far as I’m concerned. <academics>
18. The reward system of this school is insane. As a way of promoting studies, I’m for the idea that students should be awarded in some way. <academics>

214. What do you guys need the lighting at the school dispensary? I think it's well done and hopefully there are enough bulbs.<health>
215. You probably haven't visited the school hospital at night that's why you are talking like that, so it's not good to oppose something you don't know.<health>
216. Is there a school ambulance at The school dispensary? Ig if there is i am afraid i have never seen it before anywhere.<health>
217. Hey, how can a school hospital lack an ambulance surely. Are you serious my friend..... there is a Nissan ambulance that the school owns.<health>
218. Guys, I am asking since I have never seen it before.... and for the record what is the work of the school ambulance in the hospital?<health>
219. Janitors should do their cleaning at the right time to avoid inconveniences. <halls and residence>
220. More hanging lines should be fitted at the ladies’ hostels. <halls and residence> 
221. Stealing in a room should not victimize one person without clear evidence. <halls and residence>
222. The network connection at the hostels should be available 24/7. <halls and residence>
223. Nursing mothers should stay one person per room to enable privacy. <halls and residence>
224. The 10 am rule should be abolished and made an 8am rule. <halls and residence> 
225. Rooms should be equipped with fans considering the hot weather. <halls and residence>
225. The notice board at the men’s hostels need renovation. <halls and residence>
226. The mess should only be closed once the food is over and not closed before the food is finished. It inconvenience some of us with classes in between.<catering department>
227. From the look of things they should increase the number of plates, cups and spoons. People are really struggling to eat with forks.<catering department>
228. My suggestion is that each table should have a serving set of additives like salt, pepper. If someone needs to add, they don't have to go borrow the cook.<catering department>
229. The windows should be thoroughly cleaned, but of late I see the finger and handprints all over the window panes and it is disgusting to watch while eating.<catering department>
230. The catering department isn’t that strict with the covid rules that should be put in place they just let the place be.<catering department>
231. There should be sanitization on the entry of the mess to allow all the customers to be safe from contracting covid. <catering department>
232. The school has a big square fit of land and I can suggest you also build another mess for allowing the maximization of resources that will reduce overcrowding.<catering department>
233. There should be closely monitoring of students wearing masks so that prevention is done. Otherwise what I saw yesterday wasn’t pleasing, people sharing a mask. Ewww. < catering department>
234. The mess fraternity should spice it up and make some offers and introduce new dishes and not wait to serve just coldly like 1970s people here. <catering department>
235. Should be provided with disposable take away tins at a fair price just in case someone is not in position to sit and eat.<catering department>
236. My take is that when the mess fraternity is dealing with customers, they should be speaking quietly and tenderly to them otherwise the shouting I saw last week is the reason I better eat somewhere else.<catering department>
237. Inshort the school hospital should always have its ambulance near the premises since that is the sole reason for purchasing it.<health>
238. we pray that no comrade will be sick but its always a good thing to have the hospital ambulance within reach for an emergency.<health>
239. Hey just to inquire, does this school dispensary have an emergency team in case any emergency arises anytime.?<health>
240. I hope the school hospital has rooms set aside for covid 19 patients in case a case arises here in our institution.<health>
241.  The school dispensary I think should also have qualified personnel to be able to deal with covid 19 related issues in depth.<health>
242. But I am sure the rooms are already set aside by the school dispensary since there was enough time for them to procure the best materials.<health>
243. If by any case the school hospital has not done the required steps for meeting our safety against the covid 19 then it could be dangerous to us.<health>
244. These are the issues we were talking about us students having a meeting with the school's hospital head but some of you were against it.<health>
245. Only two security lights are functional at the ladies’ hostels, we need more lighting. <halls and residence>
246. I think all rooms should have shoe racks. <halls and residence>
247. Some of the toilets need renovation at mekatilili. <halls and residence>
248. There are no Rentokil at the ladies’ washrooms. We demand a reason. <halls and residence>
249. Flowers around the hostels need maintenance, they don’t look beautiful right now. <halls and residence>
250. Smoking zones should be set aside. <halls and residence> 
251. Playstation and pool should be at the men’s hostel. <halls and residence>
252. There should be a salon and cosmetics shop at ladies’ hostels. <halls and residence>
253. here should be flexibility where one needs to change the food order otherwise being strict to stick with the first order chases lot of customer.< catering department>
254. An overseer should be kept to monitor behavior of both the cooks, servers and customers on every hour meal to rectify small and big problems.<catering department> 
255. As per my view, mess should be at least renovated and also painted new colors matching with our school theme rather that the 90s looks it has.< catering department>
256. There should be a consideration of selling a variety of drinks apart from coffee and little tea that they make. < catering department>
257. All food leftovers should be dumped properly. < catering department>
258. Avoid pouring water on the floor. < catering department>
259. Avoid throwing trash anyhow. < catering department>
260. Since the mess is under government control, students with not enough pocket money should be considered first. < catering department>
261. Avoid pouring water on the tables as they are used for studying. < catering department>
262. Anyone found vandalizing the catering properties should face the consequences. < catering department>
263. Enhancing understanding between customers. < catering department>
264. Let's stop blaming each other for something we should have done in the past rather we should find a solution to our dispensary issues.<health>
265. I propose we talk with the students chairman so that he should be able to meet the school hospital leaders and talk on our behalf.<health>
266. What are you saying..... can you listen to yourself if we send the chairman it shall not be done in time for the dispensary to have that meeting.<health>
267. So what do you suggest... What should we do about this dispensary issue please my learned friends? I need your honest input.<health>
268. Guys we have no option but to tell our chairman to meet with the school hospital leader to address this issue at hand. <health>
269. Does the school dispensary help the students with babies or do the students have to pay in order to receive the service? <health>
270.  I am not sure but I think the school hospital does need the payment in order for them to treat their children. <health>
271. listen people It is a good thing that we have to fight for our friends right at the school dispensary.<health>
272. That's a very good idea my friends. Let's look at the future of our younger friends who will have to look for services at the same school hospital.<health>
273. As much as painkillers are necessary at the moment in the school hospital we should also push for the provision of good drugs. <health>
274. comrades should be able to have a chance to help the school dispensary to deliver some of its functions.<health>
275. Let us focus on the issues of lack of water at the school dispensary. This is a very hard pill to swallow because it's very essential. <health>
276. How can we be even talking about lack of water at the school dispensary really guys? It should be top priority since covid is spreading so fast. <health>
277. Love how you guys are focused on the issue of school hospitals. It's a very crucial department and it must be taken Care of. <health>
278. The most important thing at the moment in the school dispensary is that we don't lack medical attention please. It's a crucial matter.<health>
279. Ladies and gentlemen we should be able to avoid throwing dirt at the dispensary compound anyhow since it is unhygienic Most especially at a place like that. <health>
280. The school hospital should engage with the comrades so as to help them with the same issue of littering the environment there coz guys its not safe at all. <health>
281. Some of the foods sold should also be given with fruits to balance the diet. < catering department>
282. Catering department should avoid boiling food. < catering department>
283. Students trying to skip lines so that they can be served first should be removed from the lines. < catering department>
284. They should give students a chance to volunteer in helping them with duties such as dish washing. < catering department>
285. I suggest that there should be free training to students who are willing to acquire baking skills so that they can expose their skills. < catering department>
286. Students who participate in training skills should be awarded certificates to motivate them. < catering department>
287. Organizing with the school student leaders in searching for the missing catering utensils in student hostels. < catering department>
288. How does the African stew contain more vegetables than the beef itself? < catering department>
289. Catering department should avoid favoring student leaders and treat all students equally. < catering department>
290. The servers themselves should observe hygiene. < catering department>
291. Catering department servers should report to their duties on time. < catering department>
292. Each server should be able to do his duties properly. < catering department>
293. Judging on your comments fellow learned Friends i see that you are concerned with the issues of cleaning at the dispensary which is a good idea. <health>
294. The dustbin at the school hospital should be maintained, that is it should be emptied almost twice a week or so. <health>
296. I suggest that there should be an increase in the number of dustbins in and around the pathways leading to the dispensary. <health>
297. If that is the case let's also be responsible students while visiting the school hospital to ask for help from the doctors available. <health>
298. Responsibility is key because if we were responsible students we could not be complaining about this issue at the school hospital. <health>
299. The school dispensary has poor services like those equipment they are below the standard that should be having. <health>
300. I suggest that the school hospital should ask for a new ambulance since the one they got I really can't see if it has the capacity to help us. <health>
